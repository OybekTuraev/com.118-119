===================================

## Developer Tools

* [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com)

## Problem #1: "Absolute Value of Real Number" (0.4%)

The application reads a real number from the standard input and then outputs its absolute
value.

### Sample Input and Output

```
some real number? -123.345
|-123.345| = 123.345
```

```
some real number? 12.4
|12.4| = 12.4
```

## Problem #2: "Passed or Not" (0.4%)

The application reads the total number of points earned by a student in the course "Structured
Programming" and prints whether a student passed or failed this course.

### Sample Input and Output

```
Number of points? 77
You passed “Structured Programming”!!!
You should take “Object-Oriented Programming” in the next semester
```

```
Number of points? 22
You failed “Structured Programming”!!!
You can take it again in the fall semester of 2019.
```

## Problem #3: "The Maximum Value between Three Numbers" (0.4%)

The application reads three integer numbers from the standard input and finds the greatest
value between all of them.

### Sample Input and Output

```
1st number? 12
2nd number? 7
3rd number? 539
The value 539 is the greatest one.
```

```
1st number? 74
2nd number? 23
3rd number? 23
The value 74 is the greatest one.
```

## Problem #4: "Leap Year" (0.4%)

The application determines whether a certain year is a leap year.

Test data:

Leap years:
1796, 1804, 1896, 1904, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008

Common years:
1799, 1800, 1801, 1802, 1803, 1805, 1899, 1900, 1901

### Sample Input and Output

```
Year? 2000
This is a leap year.
```

```
Year? 1800
This is not a leap year.
```

## Problem #5: "Grades" (0.4%)

For a given grade in points (or percent), the application should give all possible alphabetical
grades.

Conversion table:

```
90 <= A <= 100
80 <= B < 90
70 <= C < 80
60 <= D < 70
Below 60: F
```

### Sample Input and Output

```
Number of points? 73
Grade: C
```

```
Number of points? 120
120 is not in the permitted range.
```
